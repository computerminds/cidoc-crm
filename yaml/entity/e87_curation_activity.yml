description: |
  This class comprises the activities that result in the continuity of management and the
  preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Collection, following an implicit or explicit
  curation plan.

  It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of
  curation to be recorded.

  Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period,
  material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an E78 Collection for a
  specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as
  an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting
  a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.
