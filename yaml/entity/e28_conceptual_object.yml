description: |
  This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that
  have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical
  implication. The production of such information may have been supported by the use of
  technical devices such as cameras or computers.

  Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then
  may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object
  have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper,
  electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.

  They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in
  at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are
  lost.
