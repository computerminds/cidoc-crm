  This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new
  items.

  It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an
  object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is
  no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their
  production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to
  documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may
  make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the
  inscribed one.

  This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be
  considered a single event.

  An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction
  of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from
  the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but
  identity is not.

  * Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed
    beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)
